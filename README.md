# Spring Boot Validation Demo

This demo will show how to build out and fully unit test a simple code build with Spring Boot v2.1.8 using Hibernate's Validation framwork.

Many of the standard validation rules will be shown including in the unit test why they "failed".

Taking a look at these rules (perhaps more)

* NotNull
* Blank
* Min
* Max
* Size
* Before
* After
* Pattern
